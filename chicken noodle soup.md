## chicken noodle soup

This is one recipe that we cook so often because it’s the best and most delicious way to get our veggies in with no one complaining. Why?

- Broth = good.
- Chicken = fall apart good.
- Egg noodles = carb good (sub with zucchini noodles for a low carb option).

There’s no need to use a whole chicken to make the broth for this. We cut corners in this family by using bone-in skinless chicken thighs. No skimming broth needed. No need to make a separate broth. Just one soup in one pot, and all from scratch!

## chicken broth recipe

The flavours that develop from cooking your chicken right into this soup from scratch are so much better and richer than just adding pre-cooked chicken or shredded rotisserie chicken at the end.

With a few chicken thighs (or legs) thrown in, the extra time boiling them and getting all that flavour wins over store bought broth every time.

## how to make chicken soup

We start this soup with a simple **Soffritto (Sofrito or Mirepoix).** Also know as the holy trinity of cooking. A simple combination of three aromatics:

- Onion
- Celery
- Carrots

The three are sautéed together to provide the flavour base for this soup.

For a hearty and flavourful soup, **Chicken Thighs or Legs** are ideal. The darker meats along with the bones provide a stronger taste compared to white meat (breast), creating a richer broth with plenty of flavour. Add them in along with your broth (or stock) after your soffritto is done.

**Crushed Bouillon** is an optional add in and go in along with your broth providing a lot of flavour. If you don’t have access to bouillon, use regular stock powder or omit!



Simmer until the chicken is falling off the bone and cooked through, then shred chicken with forks and throw the meat back into the soup.
